# Set your organization as public
An alternative way to set your GitHub organizations public on your profile. 
I Created this due to being in a very large organization, and was unable to search my name and set as public.

# About
Using NodeJS, Octokit, and the GitHub REST API, this is a simple way to change your organization visibility to public from private.

# Using NodeJS and npm
> Install Octokit in npm "npm i octokit" || You can also use the octokit CDN (See main.js)

> Make sure you config your personal access token. More info in main.js and here: 
https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token

> After setting up package.json and package-lock.json, run "node run.js" in your command line, or use your own command to set organization as public.
