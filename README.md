# Set your organization as public
An alternative way to set your GitHub organizations public on your profile. 
I Created this due to being in a very large organization, and was unable to search my name and set as public.

# About
Using NodeJS, Octokit, Yarn, and the GitHub REST API, this is a simple way to change your organization visibility to public from private.

> IMPORTANT: Make sure you config your personal access token. More info in main.js and here: 
https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token
Make sure your package.json "scripts" is the same as mine if "yarn start" throws an error for you.

> After setting up and ensuring /src/config.json has your access token, run "yarn start" in your command line, or use your own command to set organization as public.
